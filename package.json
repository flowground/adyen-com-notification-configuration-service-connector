    "description": "The MarketPay Notification Configuration API provides endpoints for configuration a subscription to a marketplace's MarketPay-related notifications. Notifications are sent upon the occurrence of certain events (such as a KYC check completion or a payout completion), and the subscription to these notifications dictates to where they are sent.\n\nFor further information on MarketPay notifications, please visit the [MarketPay documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/marketpay/marketpay-overview).\n## Authentication\nTo connect to the MarketPay API, you must use basic authentication credentials of your web service user. If you don't have one, please contact the [Adyen Support Team](https://support.adyen.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-U \"ws@Company.YourCompany\":\"YourWsPassword\" \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/api-reference/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nMarketPay API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Notification/v1/createNotificationConfiguration\n```",
